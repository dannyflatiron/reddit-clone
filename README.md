# Reddit Clone
### A trimmed Reddit clone app

I built this app with the intent of learning how to use bootstrap styling and build something a bit more complex than my previous Rails apps. Skills learned include bootstrap styling, handling n + 1 queries, using javascript to dynamically load html elements in a Rails app, setting up a password recovering email link sent to user's inbox.
